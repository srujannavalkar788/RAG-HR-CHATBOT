A good HR policy provides gener alized guidance on the appr oach adopt ed by the organization, and ther efore its emplo yees, concerning various aspects of emplo yment . A procedur e spells out precisel y what action should be taken in line with the policies.. The policy is rules of conduct , ther efore it is based on the following principles: a) Place right person in the right place at the right time. b) Train every emplo yee for curr ent and futur e jobs. c) Establish organization as whole a co-or dination team. d) Ensur e proper and adequat e suppl y of tools and equipment . e) Create bett er working conditions f) Give security with opportunity , incenti ve, and recognition. g) Look forw ard, plan ahead for mor e and bett er things.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS An emplo yment Contr act is an accor d that states the working relationship betw een an emplo yee and a compan y. It allows both parties to understand the rules and regulations and the terms of emplo yment . It is important to have these documents as the Indian emplo yment laws are a diverse and comple x framew ork to navigate. Ther efore, having up to date documents to prove the compan y’s compliances will protect the compan y for several years ahead. A few important laws that you must refer to before creating the compan y’s emplo yment contr acts are wage laws, labour laws, the contr act act, 1872 and the local state’s emplo yment laws. CODE OF CONDUCT The code of conduct policy of a compan y contains the vision, ethics and mission of the organization and also It is created to build and maintain the right business environment for emplo yees. It contains the rules of work that the emplo yees of the compan y much abide by.

Furthermor e, the code of conduct must include the procedur e to report a breach of the code of conduct . EMPLOYEE WAGES Managing emplo yee payroll is an important part of an HR department’s job, however, ensuring that emplo yee salaries are competiti ve in the mar ket and are compliant with government policies is also an important part of it. In India, several acts cover the wages of an emplo yee. One of them is the Minimum wage act, 1948 and also It sets the minimum wages that a skilled and unskilled labor er should recei ve. As well as it enables emplo yees to earn the ‘basic cost of living’ . Furthermor e, the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 ensur es that the emplo yee recei ves the right monthl y payment on time and without any unnecessary deductions. Ther efore, it may be tempting to only focus on the competiti ve mar ket rates, however, it is important to pay heed to the compliances requir ed for every emplo yee’s wages. At Rikalp we follow all the statut ory norms including emplo yee provident fund, emplo yee state insur ance of the eligible emplo yees. LEAVE POLICY The leave policy is created to give emplo yees a clear pictur e of the number of leaves an emplo yee is allowed to take annuall y. Furthermor e, it should also mention public holida ys. Furthermor e, the leave policy must also mention the percentage of salary cut that an emplo yee will see in the case of unpaid leaves or half-da ys. All regular emplo yees are entitled for 18 Earned Leaves in a calendar year. However, if the emplo yee has joined the organization in the middle of the calendar year, then the quantum of Earned Leaves will be pro rata basis. In case of new joiners/emplo yee transf er, following rules of leave credit will be applicable: a) Emplo yee joining/tr ansf erred before or on 10th of the month: 1.5 Leaves b) Emplo yee joining/tr ansf erred betw een 11th to 18th of the month: 1 Leave c) Emplo yee joining/tr ansf erred after 20th of the month: No Credit d) We give 0.5 leave to the emplo yee on his birthda y. e) For Initial Three Months No Paid Leave will be allowed. f) In a Notic e Period No Leave allo w. g) All leaves shall be calculat ed from date of joining of the emplo yee. h) The maximum period of casual leave which a staff is allowed to avail is 12 days in calendar year subject to a maximum of 3 days at a time, normall y.
